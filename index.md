# About BUGATTI

Enhancing the security of IoT and embedded solutions through the use of advanced security testing and automation techniques.

## The Challenge

The Internet of Things (IoT) has fundamentally changed our interaction with technology, permeating all levels of society, from consumer to industry. While increased connectivity offers unprecedented opportunities, it also brings significant security challenges.

Unfortunately, many IoT developers still view security as a cost item, resulting in this aspect being neglected. However, emerging regulations and the lack of security expertise make this a critical concern. Unlike cloud and web-based systems where solutions already exist, IoT solutions are highly diverse, each presenting unique security challenges across hardware, operating systems, and communication protocols.

## Our Mission

We make advanced **security testing tools and methods** accessible to companies and industries developing IoT and embedded solutions. Our focus is on enabling secure configuration, deployment, and management of IoT solutions that meet the highest security standards and comply with emerging regulations like the **Red Delegated Act (2025)** and **Cyber Resilience Act (2027)**.

## Target Audience

- Companies and industries developing IoT solutions
- Organizations developing embedded software
- Security professionals responsible for testing IoT solutions
- Integrators and developers of associated digital solutions

---

## Project Objectives

1. **Insight into Security Vulnerabilities** - Building expertise in identifying vulnerabilities in specific IoT ecosystems

2. **Effective Integration of Security Tools** - Implementing customized security tools through guidelines, best practices, and tutorials

3. **Improved Security Analysis** - Enhancing IoT security through advanced testing techniques with measurable coverage metrics

4. **Secure Configuration & Management** - Infrastructure-as-Code for IoT deployment, security control, and incident handling

5. **Compliance with Regulations** - Ensuring compliance with RED-DA, CRA, IEC 62443-4.x, and prEN 303 645 standards

6. **Knowledge Dissemination** - Sharing guidelines and best practices for securing IoT solutions through hands-on workshops
