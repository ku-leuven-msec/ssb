# BUGATTI - Building security Guidance, Applying pracTical Threat modellIng

## About the Project

BUGATTI is a Vlaio/COOCK tech transfer project led by KU Leuven's DistriNet research group. The project focuses on bridging the gap between academic research in threat modeling and practical security guidance for industry applications.

### Project Vision

Security threats are constantly evolving, and organizations need practical, actionable guidance to protect their systems and data. BUGATTI aims to:

- **Translate academic research** into practical threat modeling methodologies
- **Develop security guidance** that can be immediately applied in real-world scenarios
- **Foster collaboration** between research institutions and industry partners
- **Disseminate knowledge** through training, workshops, and practical tools

### Key Objectives

1. **Practical Threat Modeling**: Develop and refine threat modeling approaches that work in real development environments
2. **Security Guidance**: Create actionable security best practices and guidelines
3. **Industry Collaboration**: Work closely with industry partners to ensure relevance and applicability
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Share research findings and practical tools with the wider community

### Research Areas

- Application security and secure software development
- Threat modeling methodologies and frameworks
- Security risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Privacy by design and GDPR compliance
- Security automation and tooling

### Impact

BUGATTI bridges the gap between cutting-edge security research and practical industry needs, enabling organizations to:

- Identify and mitigate security threats more effectively
- Implement security best practices in their development processes
- Stay ahead of emerging security challenges
- Build more secure and resilient systems
